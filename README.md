# Shyftplan - README

In order to see how you work we would love to see how you perform a couple of little code projects. 
Please use the latest versions of Ruby and RoR. If at any point you feel that some task is best done in JS feel free to do what ever you think fits best.

Write code that you are proud to show. You can decide how much time to spend on the assignment, most people spend a few hours on it. We will discuss the assignment in the next interview. It would be great to see test coverage results for the tasks, and collect some metrics like line of codes, usage of rails best practices etc.

#### Submitting your application

  - Please perform both assignments
  - Create a branch of your name and which task you performed (A1 or A2) and push to your forked repository.
  - Create a pull request to master from your repository.


### Assignment 1

When in Rome (Score range 100 - 150)

Roman numbers have a unique characteristic. Most numbers can be expressed in more than one way.
Super inefficient and confusing. As if they were designed by Microsoft.

For example:  
9 can be IX or VIIII  
99 can be IC or XCIX  

Write a program in Ruby to convert a given Roman Numeral to the most efficient format (smallest string length).
Some of the crazy numbers are as follows:

MMMMCXXXIII  
CLXX  
DCCCXVIII  
MLXVII  
DLXXXX  
MMDXXI  
MMMMDLXXXXVIII  
MXXII  


### Assignment 2

Write a Rails application that that allows to user to convert celcius to fahrenheit. The application should display the two temperatures visually. Make sure the design will allow for adding more functionality later, such as doing other kinds conversions.
